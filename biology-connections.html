            <h2>Work #1 - Science Story: </h2>
            <p>My first piece of work is my science story media piece, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates my ability to design an experiment related to biology concepts with the intent of performing research.</p>

                <p>Story: </p>
                <p class="tab no-topspace">
                    I have gone to the High Desert Museum many times. While I enjoy seeing the history
                    exhibits there, I also enjoy seeing the animals and sometimes even the birds of prey event. At
                    this event they talk about many of the prominent structural and functional features of
                    carnivorous birds, including the bald eagle, hawk, and owl. Specifically, they talk about the
                    features that make these birds excellent hunters including their beaks, talons, wingspan,
                    eyesight, and speed, which they will put in perspective by comparing to our features and
                    abilities as humans. In addition to this, they will often bring one of these birds out so the
                    audience can see the bird while they are talking about it. Overall, this makes for a very
                    informative and interesting presentation every time I see it.

                <p>Summary: </p>
                <p class="tab no-topspace">
                    (1) The story provides a summary of an accessible event and includes some interesting
                    details about birds of prey including key features and examples of such birds. (2) I also included
                    some biology concepts about structural differences in species. (3) With respect to the
                    experience, I included details on my discovery of information about birds of prey and
                    interactions by seeing some of them. (4) Finally, I presented my story in a description format,
                    specifically as a summary of an event.

            <h2>Work #2 - Biology Bucket List: </h2>
            <p>My second piece of work is my body biology bucket list media piece, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it shows connections and experiences I want to have with the nature world that are different from the ones I have on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>
                Bucket List: 
                <ol class="no-topspace">
                    <li>I want to travel to see major natural landmarks, such as the Grand Canyon, and learn
                        about how they formed.</li>
                    <li>I want to see large animals in the wild, such as horses or elephants, and learn about
                        how they live and survive in nature.</li>
                    <li>I want to see something like a comet through a high-quality telescope.</li>
                    <li>I want to take care of a collection of animals, such as a dog, cat, rabbit, chicken, etc.,
                        and learn about how to do so effectively.</li>
                    <li>I want to go to space and experience what a substantial reduction in gravity feels like.</li>
