        <p class="summary">Adam Graneto's final project for Biology 103: Human Anatomy, Physiology, Disease, and Health.<br><br>
            This objective is "Biology Skills" which is about performing research about how biology relates to different organisms and environments.</p>
        <div class="body">
            <h2>Work #1 - Experimental Design: </h2>
            <p>My first piece of work is my media piece about the steps involved in an experimental design with an example, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates my ability to design an experiment related to biology concepts with the intent of performing research.</p>
            <div>
                <ol>
                <li><p>Research question: Does drinking caffeinated beverages, such as coffee or Pepsi,
                    increase by heart rate during the hour of consumption?</p>
                <li><p>Variables being tested:
                    <ul class="no-topspace">
                        <li>Heart rate - hourly minimum, maximum, and average measurements</li>
                        <li>Consumption of a caffeinated beverage</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time consumed</li>
                            <li>Quantity consumed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <li><p>Hypothesis: Drinking a caffeinated beverage will increase my heart rate during the first
                    hour of consumption</p>
                <li><p>Experimental Procedure:
                    <ul class="no-topspace">
                        <li>Control: About five times a week I will not consume any caffeinated beverages</li>
                        <li>Treatments: About twice a week I will consume a caffeinated beverage, such as a
                        morning coffee</li>
                        <li>Materials: Coffee, Pepsi, or another type of caffeinated beverage</li>
                        <li>Each time I consume a caffeinated beverage I will record the time of day it was
                        consumed, and I will examine if there is a difference in my heart rate during that
                        hour compared to the rest of the day and during the same hour on other days
                        with and without a caffeinated beverage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            <h2>Work #2 - Body Data Visualization: </h2>
            <p>My second piece of work is my body visualization media piece, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates that I am able to gather and interpret data related to biology in a way that allows me conduct a research experiment.</p>
            <p>Line Chart showing my average heart rate, average maximum heart rate, and average minimum
                heart rate for each hour of the day from 7AM to 10PM:
