        <p class="summary">Adam Graneto's final project for Biology 103: Human Anatomy, Physiology, Disease, and Health.<br><br>
            This objective is "Human Concepts" which is about our understanding of humans as a species.</p>
        <div class="body">
            <h2>Work #1 - Techniques for Improving Learning</h2>
            <p>My first piece of work is my quiz answer on utilizing various techniques to iprove, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates my understanding of how humans learn and the importance our nervous system.</p>
            <P class="tab">
                When it comes to learning, I utilize a few techniques to improve my ability. First, goal insight is critical because when you know what your objective is and what success looks like, it is much easier to be able to set a course. Specifically, I often shoot for getting at least 90% in my courses, which I use as a goal for myself. Next is repetition, which is especially valuable when trying to memorize something, since you are doing something repeatedly. This is a technique I often employ when studying, as I will try to match certain concepts with their definition or purpose repeatedly at many different times and locations of the day to help ingrain the information in my memory. Another technique is trial and error, where you make mistakes and learn from them to try to improve performance. I utilize this with class assignments, especially during the beginning of the course, in order to get a feel for what is expected out of me in the completion of my assignments. Finally is the reduction of interferences, which is critical because distraction can easily impede the ability to learn. I utilize this technique by doing all of my work in my own room with the door closed so that I can concentrate on the task I am working on.             </P>

            <h2>Work #2 - Digestion Game</h2>
            <p>My second piece of work is my media piece for a game about the digestive system, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates my understanding of the different components of the human digestive system.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Game Title: Digestion Construction</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Age rating: This is a game made for all ages, elementary school and up.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instructions:</span>
                <br>(The game plays somewhat similarly to Go Fish)<br>
                Setup:<br>
                For a two player game, each player starts with a hand of 6 cards.<br>
                For a three player game, each player starts with a hand of 4 cards.<br>
                For a four player game, each player starts with a hand of 3 cards.<br>
                On your turn you may:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Draw one card from the draw pile (if not empty)</li>
                    <li>If this is not the first turn of the game:</li>
                    <li>You may steal a card from your opponentâ€™s hand by asking if your opponent has
                    a specific card, but only if that card has not been stolen in the last round of play.
                    If he or she has that card then he or she must give it to you. Otherwise, that
                    opponent may take one card at random from your hand.</li>
                    <li>Play one complete set of cards. If you can play a complete set, then you may draw an
                    extra card before ending your turn. Place these cards face up, they cannot be stolen or
                    returned to your hand.</li>
                </ul>
                Once the deck of cards is empty, each player, including the current player, gets one more turn
                before the game ends.</p>
                <p>Scoring:<br>
                Each player gets two points for each card in a complete set. Each player gets one point for each
                card if they have a majority but not all of the cards in a set.
                The player with the most points wins the game.</p>
