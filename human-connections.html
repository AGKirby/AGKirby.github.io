            <h2>Work #1 - An Oxygen Molecule's Journey During Respiration: </h2>
            <p><strong>Here is my description of the path an oxygen molecule takes through the human body during the process of respiration:</strong><br><br>
                <p class="tab">An oxygen molecule inhaled through the nose first travels to pharynx or the back of the throat. It then goes past the epiglottis tissue 
                and into the larynx, where the vocal cords are, before travelling down the trachea. Once in the lungs, it will travel down one of the two 
                primary bronchi, which split into smaller secondary bronchi, before splitting again into even smaller bronchioles. After traveling down 
                one of these paths, the oxygen molecule will enter into an alveoli at the end of the bronchioles. Here it passes through the very thin-walled 
                capillaries and becomes attached to a red blood cell. Now within the blood vessels, the oxygen molecule will be taken by the red blood 
                cell back to the heart through the pulmonary vein. Here it will enter into the left atrium, pass through the valve into the left ventricle, 
                before leaving the heart through the aorta. Travelling through an artery leaving the heart, the artery will split into smaller arterioles 
                where the red blood cell will take a path. The arterioles will split as well, this time into even smaller capillaries of which the red blood 
                cell will take another path. Upon arriving at the cells of an organ, such as the liver, the red blood cell and oxygen will split, with the red 
                blood cell making its way back to the heart while the oxygen passes through the thin-walled membrane of a cell where it will be used by that 
                cell for cellular respiration.</p><br>
                Note: I was on the fence about including this for human connections (as a story about the path of an oxygen molecule) or biology concepts (as an explanation of respiration).
