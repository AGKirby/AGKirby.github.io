            This objective is "Science Skills" which is about making discoveries and insights about the natural world.</p>
        <div class="body">
            <h2>Work #1 - Steps of a Science Discovery: </h2>
            <p>My first piece of work is my quiz answer about the three stages of making a science discovery, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates my knowledge about how to make science insights and provides an example of me doing that.</p>
            <div>
                <p class="tab">The first step in the process of science discovery is exploration. This step involves investigating a natural phenomena that is new to you. A real world example from my life is when I was on a trip to Hawaii, I went to a museum that talked about the history of the islands and how they formed by volcanic activity.</p>
                <p class="tab">The second step in the process of science discovery is description. This step involves describing details about a natural phenomena. Back to my Hawaii example, the museum discussed the process by which volcanoes erupt and how the islands then form. </p>
                <p class="tab">The third step in the process of science discovery is explanation. This step involves explaining the information about how or why something happens. Back to my Hawaii example, the museum also discussed how the movement of the Pacific plate causes a chain of islands to be formed. In particular, I was very surprised to learn just how long the chain of islands is and how the island of Midway is within this chain. </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2>Work #2 - Class Notes: </h2>
            <p>My second piece of work is my first media piece in the class which is a sample of the notes I took, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates that I am able to gather and organize information in a way that allows me to make new discoveries.</p>
