            <h2>Work #1 - My Personalized Safety Checklist: </h2>
            <p>My first piece of work is my media piece about my personalized safety checklist when conducting experiments, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates that I know how to conduct research in a safe manner.</p>
            <p>This is my personalized safety checklist that I use when doing experiments, either inside or outside: 
                <ul>
                    <lh>Laboratory/Indoor Safety:</lh>
                    <li><span class="blue">Wear</span> eye protection when working with chemicals.</li>
                    <li>Be cautious with loose <span class="blue">clothing</span> near flames.</li>
                    <li>Put newspapers or similar items on the table to protect it if the experiment is <span class="orange">messy</span>.</li>
                    <li>Be careful not to drop anything on the ground so my <span class="green">dog</span> does not get it.</li>
                    <li>Always <span class="red">read</span> instructions carefully.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <lh>Field/Outdoor Safety:</lh>
                    <li><span class="blue">Wear</span> shoes to protect my feet.</li>
                    <li><span class="blue">Use</span> sunscreen if it is a sunny day</li>
                    <li>Be careful not to leave a <span class="orange">mess</span> so my <span class="green">dog</span> does not get into it</li>
                    <li>Be cautious with nearby <span class="green">animals</span>, including deer</li>
                    <li><span class="red">Avoid</span> going somewhere that can lead to a potentially dangerous situation</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <lh>Both: </lh>
                    <li><span class="blue">Wear</span> pants and long sleeves to protect the skin</li>
                    <li><span class="blue">Wear</span> gloves when necessary</li>
                    <li>Consider the safety of <span class="green">others</span> nearby, including my <span class="green">dog</span></li>
                    <li>When walking around, be careful not to trip over my <span class="green">dog</span></li>
                    <li>Do not <span class="lightblue">eat or drink</span> when working with chemicals, animals, or waste products</li>
                    <li>Do not <span class="lightblue">taste or smell</span> anything used for the experiment unless absolutely sure it is safe</li>
                    <li>Always <span class="lightblue">clean</span> up the lab space when done</li>
                    <li><span class="lightblue">Wash</span> hands well both before and after the experiment</li>
                    <li>Always <span class="red">follow</span> safety directions</li>
                    <li><span class="red">Communicate</span> safety concerns with others involved</li>
                    <li>Always have a <span class="red">first aid kit</span> nearby and easily accessible</li>
                    <li>Seek <span class="red">medical assistance</span> if necessary</li>
                    <li>Add new safety procedures as needed</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Work #2 - First Aid: </h2>
            <p>My second piece of work is my first aid media piece, which shows my mastery of the course objective because 
                it demonstrates the importance of safety and first aid training as a human skill for safety.</p>
            <p>I choose the online training offered on the Red Crossâ€™s <a href="https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/first-aid-training/first-aid-online" target="_blank">website</a>.<br>
                I chose this form of first aid training because it seemed like it would be the most
                applicable, since I am not going into any healthcare related field, and the most reliable,
                since the Red Cross is a trusted source. In addition, I do not need to be certified for
                anything I am doing, so the online course presents a more accessible option that will
                allow me to go through the course at my own pace and focus on the areas that I think
                would be most relevant for me.
