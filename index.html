                <p class="tab">My final portfolio for Biology 103 is a website that is split into nine pages showing my
                mastery of the course outcomes plus this introduction page. Each of these nine course mastery
                outcome pages contains two pieces of my work that demonstrates my mastery for that page’s
                course outcome, such as Biology Connections for example. Through these 18 pieces of work,
                they will each demonstrate my mastery of the course concepts by showing what I have learned
                and how I have applied that knowledge into media pieces or answers to quiz questions.</p>
                <p class="tab"> Each of these pages can be accessed in the grid below. In addition, you can also access
                them via the drop down menu in the navigation bar at the top of each page. You can return to
                this introductory page by clicking on the website’s title on the left side of the navigation bar,
                using the drop down menu in the navigation bar, or using the link in the footer at the bottom of
                every page.</p>
                <p class="tab">In the future, I intend to use this portfolio as a way to have easy access to essential and
                key biology ideas that I can use to draw upon when I need to remember something I have
                learned. That is why I wanted to make it a website so that I could always access it from both my
                computer and my phone, thus allowing me to access it anywhere I may need it.</p>
